Steve Milligan: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our June quarter performance and our outlook for the September quarter. Demand for our fourth fiscal quarter was lower than expected given a week PC market. In that context I am satisfied with our performance. We reported revenues of $3.2 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 29.8% and diluted earnings per share of $1.51. Our storage shipments for the June quarter were 56 exabytes up 2% year-over-year. Our results reflect strong product and technology positioning coupled with solid execution. Our enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $244 million demonstrating the continued success and broadening customer acceptance of our leading SaaS SSD products. We expanded our footprint in the enterprise SSD space with the initial ramp of our new UltraStar PCIe NVMe offering. It is been qualified with several leading customers and we expect revenue from this product to increase throughout fiscal 2016. We saw strong demand for our high-capacity helium and 15K RPM 2.5 inch performance hard drives. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives continued its rapid growth as we expanded our lineup of these purpose filed solutions. And we continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new active archive system. Our view of persistent data growth remains intact driven by mobility and the cloud. The outlook for enterprise storage business remains healthy and we believe we are well position to address this growing market space. Regarding PC market demand we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the near term given the timing of the Windows 10 and Skylake launches. That being said we are seeing early signs of market stabilization. Leading us to believe that PC market demand could pick up towards the end of this calendar year. On more stable PC market demand environment coupled with continued strength in our enterprise business provides the opportunity for improving financial performance as we move through the fiscal year. In the mean time we will continue to be discipline to the management of our business while being ready to address unanticipated upside if it materializes. I would like to comment on the status of our discussions with China's Ministry of Commerce. Since our last earnings we believe we have made meaningful progress. We have met with MOFCOM several times to discuss their review process and a potential time table for them to complete their work. We have submitted a comprehensive report on the current market which we believe shows that the storage eco-system has evolved significantly in the last three years and that lifting the hold separate restriction will enhance competition, increase innovation and benefit customers. We have also met with several other stakeholders in China and shared our view on the benefits of lifting the hold separate. Based on our conversations with MOFCOM we believe that they are working steadily on several fronts and we are hopeful that they can conclude their evaluation of our application to lift the hol separate in the near future. Olivier will now provide a summary of our June quarter performance and our outlook.

Olivier Leonetti: Thank you Steve. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.2 billion. We shipped a total of 48.5 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 29.8% and operating expenses totaled $560 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million or 7% of non-GAAP pre-tax income.
